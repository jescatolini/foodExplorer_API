### _Starting the application_

  ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/jescatolini/foodExplorer_API
  ```

- Enter the directory:

  ```bash
    $ cd food_explorer-backend/
  ```

- Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
    $ npm install
  ```

- Set up the environment variables. For example:

  ```JS

  ```bash
    Server is running on port 3333.
  ```

- To access the resources of this API, use the following base URL:

  `http://localhost:3333`

  - Show an order
  - Show all orders

- #### **SESSIONS**


  ##### **Create a Session**
    For most of the requests, the application expects a Bearer token (JWT) in the request header, which means the user needs to be authenticated.
    The following resources do not require authentication:

    - Show all dishes.
    - Show dish details.
    - Create an account.
    - Log in.

    To generate a token, make a request to the URL:

    `http://localhost:3333/sessions`

    The request should be made with the POST method, using JSON with the following format:

    ```JSON
      {
          "email": "your@email.com",
          "password": "yourPassword123"
      }
    ```
    If everything goes well, you should receive the following response:

    ```JSON
      {
      "user": {
          "name": "User",
          "email": "user@email.com",
          "avatar": "cdcdd64d04f5a7a79897-your-photo.jpeg"
      },
      "token": "158525ede2c8d232cca.5f0cc70b2547d642f44ede2c1715455cca.2655254cc70b2542f44ede2c8d232cca"
      }
    ```

- #### **USERS**


  - ##### **Register a User**

    To create a user, we will use the "users" resource, and the URL will be:

    `http://localhost:3333/users`

    The request should be made with the POST method, using JSON with the following format:

    ```JSON
      {
          "name": "Your Name",
          "email": "your@email.com",
          "password": "yourPassword123"
      }
    ```

    If everything goes well, you should receive a response with the status code 201.

    **Note**: To register a user as an administrator, the user's email must have the same structure as defined in the environment variables.

  - ##### Update a User
    To update a user, we will use the "users" resource, and the URL will be:

    `http://localhost:3333/users/`

    The request should be made with the PUT method, using JSON with the following format:

    ```JSON
    {
      "name": "Jhonata",
      "email": "jhonata@email.com",
      "old_password": "123",
      "new_password": "123456"
